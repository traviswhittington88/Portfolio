      <h3><span style="color:teal">BIO</span></h3>
      <p> I am a web developer and recent graduate of Thinkful’s Full Stack Web Development program.  To say I love coding
        is an understatement. <b><em>I have a drive and passion that are unmatched when it comes to solving problems 
        through logic and technology.</em></b>  I developed this passion early on in my military career as a 
        <span style="color: coral"><b>Pashto</b></span> linguist where I thrived interpreting the official language
        Afghanistan. It only makes sense that I would find the field of full stack development so satisfying and rewarding. 
        Not only that, I love people and building solutions to those human problems that occassionaly crop up, especially
        using communication as a tool to strengthem teams and friendship. As a developer and keen listener, 
        <b><em>the idea of transforming problems into solutions is a process that truly resonates with me.</em></b></p>

      <p> My life outside of coding is also extremely fulfilling. When I’m not at my desk, I’m usually chasing my 3 
        children around! I have a very supportive wife who has supported me through this journey and it would be difficult 
        to say she hasn’t been a large part of my success.  Being a young father doesn’t guarantee a lot of free time. 
        However, if there is a spare moment I will be playing guitar, writing music, reading books, or trying to increase 
        my knowledge about the world around me.<span style="color:rgb(0, 119, 255)"> To put it simply, I love to 
        learn!</span>"</p>

      <p><b><em>  My favorite aspect of full-stack development is using Javascript and its various frameworks to create the 
        actual functionality behind each project or application.</em></b>  Sure, I enjoy styling and semantic HTML like the 
        rest of them, but when it comes to truly realizing the intent of a design, Javascript can be super fun! With that 
        said, I also dedicate a lot of thought into styling my apps and making them look just right. I will spend hours of
         personal time altering fonts or layouts and then experimenting by showing potential users the various designs and 
         gathering their feedback and opinions.</p>

        <h4>Rock N' Roll Quiz App</h4>
        <p> This application presents the user with 10 rock trivia questions. It provides feedback for each 
          question (right or wrong), increments the question number and score accordingly, and then displays 
          the overall results. The visual design of the application is based around bright, eye-catching 
          colors with notable music legends Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. The fonts are large and easy to 
          read in contrast to the colorful background. The idea for this app is to keep it simple and make 
          the controls as user friendly as possible</p><div class="links"><a target="_blank"

        <h4>TasteFinder</h4>
        <p>Taste Finder is a fun and useful application that integrates the Tastedive and Youtube APIs to present 
          recommendation information in a new and exciting way. The dark grey background was chosen intentionally to 
          highlight the more eye-popping art and colorfol neons that appear on the page, without being two overwhelming 
          on the eyes. The ice-cream cone logo is 100% original and was designed by my uncle Daniel Packard, who is an 
          amazing artist. He really brought the application together with this final touch.</p>

          The UX if simple and relies on you to click a search tab: anything, books, authors, movies, music. 
          From there, you type any string related to the tab selected above e.g. music/Pink Floyd, and 
          click recommmend. Taste Finder currently recommends a single media type in response and 
          produces 3 related videos from Youtube, but this is not set in stone. I will continue 
          to change the application based on user requests because I believe a good application 
          is one that is flexible.</p>
